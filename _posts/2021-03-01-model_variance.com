This post is an exploration based on this [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-logistic-regression-over-decision-trees-Are-there-any-cases-where-its-better-to-use-logistic-regression-instead-of-decision-trees/answer/Claudia-Perlich?ch=10&share=ef233af4&srid=28C3J
) by Claudia Perlich. The post will try to explore a but further in what circumstances some low variance models outperform high variance models.
