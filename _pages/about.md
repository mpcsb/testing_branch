Welcome to TestingBranch. This space serves as a repository of my tech explorations and experiments. These posts often originate from side projects or assignments from my professional endeavors.  

My name is Miguel Batista. This blog's objective is to document the results, the learning, the failures, and the successes.  

As TestingBranch evolves, expect to see posts become more polished, narratives more clear, and ideas continually updating.  

Your thoughts and feedback are always welcome. If you'd like to share your ideas or ask a question, drop a line at miguelcbatista [at] gmail [dot] com.  

Thank you for dropping by TestingBranch. I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity.
