This is a personal blog containing experiments or tests I've carried out over time: something that would reside in a sandbox or a branch created to test some off feature.   
All post will likely get better cosmetics and a clearer narrative to make points stick, so it's likely that some evolution takes place.  

Let me know what you think!
