This is a personal blog containing experiments or tests I've carried out over time: essentially the content of the blog is something that would reside on a sandbox or on a branch created to test some feature.   
All post will likely get better cosmetics and a clearer narrative; it's likely that some evolution takes place.

Let me know what you think!
