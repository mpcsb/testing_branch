[GoPy](https://github.com/go-python/gopy) generates (and compiles) a CPython extension module from a go package.  
Go is forced by the compiler to be simple and that make it a great language to collaborate on. Because very complex patterns are hard to implement, whatever code you write ends up being fairly readable and whatever code you find ends  is easy to work on.  
In case you find yourself in a scenario where the vast python ecosystem is not providing you with what you need, you'll need to build something in a lower level language. This post focus on writing Go code and how to integrate it with python.
